								<h3><b>Undergraduate at Northland College</b></h3>
									<p style="float:left;text-align:justify;width:82.0%;margin-right:2.0%">I was always fascinated by the natural world. As a child, I played outside for hours; swimming, running through the woods, climbing trees, building forts - the typical kid things. These experiences led me to pursue a B.Sc. at Northland College in Natural Resources. Northland College is a liberal arts college in northern Wisconsin with a progressive focus on the environment. Northland was the perfect place to kick-start my conservation and ecological career. With Lake Superior in my backyard, I found it effortless to develop a strong relationship to large lakes. I worked for the USGS Lake Superior Biological Station as an undergraduate technician and my passion for the Great Lakes, fisheries, and research blossomed. My time at Northland College culminated in the publication of my <a href="https://bioone.org/journals/the-american-midland-naturalist/volume-175/issue-1/amid-175-01-24-36.1/Age-Growth-and-Size-of-Lake-Superior-Pygmy-Whitefish-Prosopium/10.1674/amid-175-01-24-36.1.short" target="_blank" style="color:LightBlue">undergraduate thesis</a> on Lake Superior pygmy whitefish (<i>Prosopium coulterii</i>) in the American Midland Naturalist.</p>

								<h3><b>Working Life - Where, When, and What I Learned</b></h3>
									<p style="float:left;text-align:justify;width:82.0%;margin-right:2.0%">After graduating from Northland, I decided to work in the fisheries field to get further hands-on experience and develop and refine my research interests. For two years, I worked at the USGS Lake Erie Biological Station as part of a research team studying how food webs can be used to describe ecological change. One of my greatest takeaways from this position was the opportunity to diversify my field and lab experiences and data computation and visualization skills. I was given lots of freedom to pursue independent projects and ideas, including developing an <a href="https://lebs.shinyapps.io/western-basin/" target="_blank" style="color:LightBlue">interactive website</a> which reports trends in the western basin ecosystem of Lake Erie using R, and writing sections of annual reports. My time at USGS fueled my passion to become a professional fisheries scientist. Graduate school was the obvious next step to achieve my goals.</p>

								<h3><b>Graduate School</b></h3>
									<p style="float:left;text-align:justify;width:82.0%;margin-right:2.0%">In 2016, I began my Ph.D. at the University of Vermont (UVM). UVM was a natural decision because of its location and reputation as an environmentally conscious university. My choice of research topic was deeply personal and a lifetime in the making. I am no stranger to cold winters after living in Wisconsin for 22 years. However, not all winters were cold. In 2012, I can remember jumping into the ice-free, yet frigid, waters of Lake Superior in March - yeah, I may be a little crazy! Two years later, a Polar Vortex created record high ice coverage on Lake Superior in March. Was this variability normal or was change in the air? What effect might this variability have on fish and other aquatic organisms? These questions became a central theme of my Ph.D. program. My dissertation is focused on quantifying and modeling how climate change impacts aquatic ecosystems. Specifically, I am quantifying how changing environmental conditions, such as ice formation, influence embryo incubation, development, and subsequent survival of larval freshwater whitefishes in the Great Lakes and across the globe. I am collaborating with aquatic ecologists, evolutionary biologists, and geneticists from France, Finland, Germany, Italy, Austria, Sweden, Canada, and the USA.</p>

								<h3><b>Personal Life</b></h3>
									<p style='text-align:justify'>I am an avid outdoors enthusiast always looking for the next mountain to climb, or ski up (yes, up!) depending on the season. My free time is usually spent kayaking, alpine and backcountry skiing, trail running, camping, biking, or fishing. During my less active time, you can usually find me sitting around a campfire, enjoying a craft beer, woodworking, or catching up on the latest R news.</p>

								<h3><b>The Problem: Climate Change</b></h3>
									<p style='text-align:justify'>A growing body of evidence suggests that the Earth’s climate is changing. How large-lake ecosystems respond to climate change is an area of concern because of the many ecological and socio-economic services these systems provide. Fish contribute in numerous ways to the diversity and functioning of aquatic ecosystems, and to the health, well-being, and economies across all continents. If fish become less common as a consequence of changing environmental conditions, the negative effects could be felt throughout the entire ecosystems they occupy! Understanding how aquatic organisms may adapt to climate change is crucial for management agencies to conserve and maintain diverse, abundant, and healthy populations of native species.</p><br />
									
								<h3><b>Integrative Approach</b></h3>
									<p style='text-align:justify'>One way to understand whether species are vulnerable to environmental changes is to investigate how different populations of the same species have historically adapted to different climates. I am using a combination of laboratory experiments, field sampling, remote sensing, and modeling to explore how environmental variability and climate change are likely to influence recruitment bottlenecks within cold-water fish populations, such as cisco (Coregonus artedi), in the Great Lakes and around the world.</p><br />

										<span>Lakes can act as sentinels of climate change, where changes in the surrounding area are reflected in the aquatic ecosystem. A direct impact of climate change on lakes is climate-driven variation in water temperatures and ice cover, with potential consequences for a broad range of physical and ecological impacts. Patterns in seasonal water temperature and ice cover variability in the Great Lakes are being examined to determine the magnitude of change occurring and when major regime shifts occurred. The Great Lakes provide an ideal region to study environmental change because all five of the lakes (1) experience distinct seasonality, (2) are among the largest freshwater lakes in the world, and (3) provide a gradient in lake physical properties (<i>e.g.,</i> bathymetry, morphology, clarity). Seasonal variability in abiotic lake characteristics may have important implications on community structure and production, organismal life-history, and biotic interactions.</span>
									</p>
									<p style="float:left;text-align:justify;width:31.7%;margin-right:2.4%;margin-bottom:1.0%">
										<span>Climate change is implicated in shifting fish reproductive phenology. Thermal habitat changes include warmer water temperature, a longer growing season, decreased ice-cover, and more rapid spring warming. Because fish are cold-blooded, such changes in thermal habitat may affect their growth, survival, and reproduction. Coregonines are cold-water fishes that typically spawn during late-autumn or early-winter, and their eggs incubate over winter and hatch in spring. I am developing a degree-day model to evaluate latitudinal differences in, and potential impacts of, changing thermal habitat on the relationship between spawning and hatching dates. The model will be applied to three coregonines from North America and Europe across different latitudes. Phenological shifts and higher annual variability in reproduction could lead to mismatches with larval zooplankton prey and may be related to the coregonine recruitment declines observed worldwide.</span>
									</p>
									<p style="float:left;text-align:justify;width:31.7%;margin-bottom:1.0%">
										<span>Climate change may affect organisms throughout their geographical range and many studies highlight distributional shifts as a key response. However, species that reside in and are restricted to lake systems, such as coregonines, have few, if any, opportunities to migrate. Consequently, the persistence of coregonines depends on their plasticity and adaptive potential. In this context, an international scientific consortium representing 13 countries formed to evaluate the short-term adaptive response to changing thermal regimes of different coregonine species, including cisco and lake whitefish (<i>C. clupeaformis</i>) in North America and vendace (<i>C. albula</i>) and European whitefish (<i>C. lavaretus</i>) in Europe. We are experimentally identifying the ecological and genetic mechanisms driving latitudinal and longitudinal variation in egg and larval development, growth, and survival across a suite of congeners with similar and contrasting life history traits.</span>
