Mentoring
--------

**Undergraduate Researchers:**    

* **Ariana Maleki** and **John Matthew Fisher** worked on developing microsatellites for population
genetic work on common woodland ants.     

* **Kerri Pinder**, **Skyler Resendez**, and **Jeremy Pustilnik** worked on how previous exposures to
starvation and desiccation impact thermal tolerance and underlying stress responses (using heat
shock proteins as a proxy). [This work led to a manuscript in the Journal of Comparative Physiology B](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00360-017-1101-x)      
 
* **Teddy Herriman** and **Austin Sherburne** worked on identifying potential morphological
innovations that may temper and/or mitigate the effects of heat stress.     

* **Curtis A. Provencher** worked on how experimental warming affects the stress levels of common
woodland ants.     

* **Megan Brown** and **Jordan Zitnay** identified trade-offs between constitutive and induced cold
tolerances at the northern range boundary in common forest ants, likely constraining their
northern expansion.
